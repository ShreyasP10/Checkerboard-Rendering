# Contributing to RDR2 Checkerboard Rendering Mod (CBR)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **RDR2 Checkerboard Rendering Mod** project! This project aims to recreate the PlayStation 4 Pro checkerboard rendering pipeline in *Red Dead Redemption 2* for PC, with a special focus on Pascal GPUs such as the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 Ti.

## 🛠️ Areas Needing Contribution

1. **RAGE Engine Reverse Engineering:**
   - Identifying view-projection matrix uniform buffer addresses across RDR2 game versions.
   - Tracing velocity/motion vector render targets or vertex/pixel shader outputs.
   - Verifying the status and function of `PostFX::g_CheckerBoardEnable` in game memory.
2. **Graphics API Hooking (Vulkan & DX12):**
   - Hooking swapchain presentation, render passes, and sub-allocated memory targets.
   - Robust MinHook integration that co-exists peacefully with other popular mods (ScriptHookRDR2, LML, ReShade).
3. **Compute Shader Optimization:**
   - Tuning the reconstruction compute shader for Pascal GP104 hardware (optimizing shared memory tiling, register pressure, wave occupancy).
   - Refining temporal disocclusion detection and YCoCg neighborhood color clamping to eliminate ghosting on moving edges.
4. **Testing & Validation:**
   - Benchmarking frame-time deltas and VRAM utilization on different GPU architectures.

## 📋 Code Guidelines & Style

- **Language Standard:** C++20.
- **Shaders:** GLSL 4.60 (Vulkan SPIR-V) and HLSL (Shader Model 6.0).
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - Classes and Structs: `PascalCase` (e.g., `RenderTargetManager`)
  - Functions and Methods: `PascalCase` or `camelCase` (consistent within modules)
  - Member Variables: `m_camelCase` (e.g., `m_frameIndex`)
  - Constants and Macros: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `CBR_MAX_HISTORY_BUFFERS`)
- **Documentation:** Maintain clear comments explaining non-trivial rendering mathematics, matrix operations, and hooking logic.

## 🔒 Safety and Anti-Cheat Policy

- **Strictly Offline:** All code and hooks developed in this repository are strictly intended for single-player / story mode.
- Any pull requests, code, or features designed to bypass anti-cheat systems or facilitate online multiplayer injection will be immediately rejected and closed.
